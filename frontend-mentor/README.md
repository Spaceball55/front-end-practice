This project is just practice by me to improve my skills in front-end web development! I am specifically focusing on better website structure using HTML and CSS and making my websites more responsive with JS. </br></br>

To do this, I am using frontend-mentor's challenges. Since I am cheap, I am just doing the free challenges. </br></br>

Right now, the pages are hosted on a localhost.
